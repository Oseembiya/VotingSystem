# VotingSystem

- Team Roles:
  
  Team Leader (SCRUM Master): Guides and coaches the Scrum team, removes impediments, and ensures adherence to Scrum practices.
  Secretary: Assists the team leader with administrative tasks, focusing on organizational and administrative support.
  2x Developers: Responsible for delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of every Sprint. They collaborate closely and share accountability for the success of each Sprint.
  1x Tester: Ensures the quality and reliability of the software by identifying and fixing defects or issues.
  
- Project Overview:
  
  The team must select and implement an appropriate data structure to store voting data details for searching.
  Time complexity analysis of key operations using this data structure is required.
  
- Scenario:
  
  The program must use an appropriate data structure to store voting data and allow the user to specify the input file name. The focus is on library and search functionality.
- Detailed Description:
  Set up Project: Create an Azure DevOps git repository and makefile for the project.
  Plan Software: Design and implement a class to store the necessary data details.
  Design Data Structure/Algorithm: Design data structure(s) and associated algorithms for storing and searching data. Analyze time complexity and justify the selection.
  Implement Data Structure/Algorithm: Implement the designed data structure(s) and algorithms.
  Test Data Structure: Apply software testing (using catch2) to ensure correctness.
  Read Sample Data File: Implement reading and processing sample data from the given file using the data structure(s).
  Implement Menu: Develop an intuitive command-line user interface.
  Write Report: Document time complexity analysis and test cases in the report.

# VotingSystem

Team Leader (SCRUM Master): Responsible for guiding and coaching the Scrum team, removing impediments, and ensuring adherence to Scrum practices.
Secretary: Assists the team leader with administrative tasks, focusing on organizational and administrative support.
2x Developers: A cross-functional team responsible for delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of every Sprint. They collaborate closely and share accountability for the success of each Sprint.
1x Tester: Responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of the software by identifying and fixing defects or issues.
The team must select and implement an appropriate data structure to store data details for searching. Time complexity analysis of the key operations using this data structure is also required.
- 2. Scenario
The team's program must use an appropriate data structure to store voting data and allow the user to specify the input file name. The focus is on the library and search functionality.

- 3 Detailed Description
3.1 Set up Project
Create an Azure DevOps git repository and makefile for the project.
3.2 Plan Software
Design and implement a class to store the necessary details of the data.
3.3. Design Data Structure/Algorithm
Design the data structure(s) and associated algorithms for storing and searching data.
Analyze the time complexity of the algorithms and justify the selection based on program requirements.
3.4. Implement Data Structure/Algorithm
Implement the designed data structure(s) and algorithms.
3.5. Test Data Structure
Apply software testing (using catch2) to ensure the Track class, data structures, and algorithms work correctly.
3.6. Read Sample Data File
I'd like for you to try reading the sample data from the given file and process it using the data structure(s).
3.7. Implement Menu
Could you implement an intuitive command-line user interface to allow users to achieve the required functionality?
3.8. Write Report
Write a report including time-complexity analysis and test cases prepared while designing the software.

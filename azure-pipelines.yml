# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: make -f Makefile all
  displayName: 'Build Project'

# - script: make -f Makefile test
#   displayName: 'Run Tests'

# - task: PublishTestResults@2
#   inputs:
#     testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
#     testRunTitle: 'Unit Tests'

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathtoPublish: 'Bin'  # Assuming build artifacts are in the 'Bin' directory
    artifactName: 'MyBuildArtifacts'
